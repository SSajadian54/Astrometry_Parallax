# Astrometry_Parallax


There are two c++ codes here, which simulate the astrometric microlensing events including the parallax 
effect, towards the Galactic bulge and Magellanic clouds. To include parallax, I assume a circular orbit
for  the Earth motion around the Sun.   

My aim from these codes was to study the impact of Earth-induced parallax on the astrometric 
deflection of the source motions in microlensing events. 

These codes for each microlensing event produce two files: one include the models, and the second one 
includes the synthetic data points for these events.
